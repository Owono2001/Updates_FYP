## üéØ **Core Features**

* üß† **Real-time AI Stutter Detection:** Utilizes a custom-trained Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model to classify speech into four distinct categories (`Block`, `Prolongation`, `Interjection`, `Fluent`) from a live audio stream.
* üìä **Interactive Visualization:** Provides users with a real-time waveform display and a color-coded timeline that visualizes detected speech patterns, offering immediate and intuitive feedback.
* üèãÔ∏è **Personalized Exercise Regimen:** An adaptive planner (`AdaptivePlanner`) analyzes session results to recommend targeted exercises from a comprehensive library (`exercises.json`), focusing on areas like breathing, vocal control, and fluency.
* üìà **Advanced Progress Analytics:** A dedicated progress screen (`ProgressFragment`) with multiple charts showing fluency trends over time, stutter pattern breakdowns, and weekly improvement metrics.
* üè• **Clinical & Therapist Dashboard:** A secure, role-based dashboard for therapists to view patient progress, create assessments, and manage therapy plans, demonstrating the app's potential for professional use.
* üîí **Secure User Authentication:** A complete authentication system using Firebase for email/password sign-in, user registration, and secure profile management with role separation (`patient` vs. `therapist`).
* üåê **Multi-Language Support:** The UI is architected with full support for localization, with string resources provided for over 11 languages.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Data Flow**

The application employs a robust, scalable architecture combining a modern Android client with a powerful Python backend for AI inference.

1.  **Client-Side (MVVM):** The Android app uses the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to separate UI (`Fragments`/`XML`) from business logic (`ViewModels`) and data operations (`Repositories`). This ensures a maintainable and testable codebase.

2.  **Server-Side (AI Inference):** The computationally expensive AST model is hosted on a Python Flask server. The Android client streams 3-second chunks of audio data; the server performs preprocessing, runs model inference, and returns a JSON object with the 4-class probabilities.

### **End-to-End Data Flow**

| Step | Action                      | Location        | Key Technology                                   |
| :--: | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | **User Speaks** | Android App     | `AudioRecord` API                                |
|  2   | **Audio is Buffered** | Android App     | `RealTimeStutterDetector` (Kotlin Ring Buffer)   |
|  3   | **Data Sent to Server** | Network         | `Retrofit2` HTTP POST Request                    |
|  4   | **Audio Processed** | Python Server   | `Librosa` (Mel-Spectrogram)                      |
|  5   | **AI Prediction** | Python Server   | `PyTorch` (AST Model)                            |
|  6   | **Results Returned** | Network         | `Flask` JSON Response                            |
|  7   | **App State Updated** | Android App     | `ViewModel` with `StateFlow`                     |
|  8   | **UI Reacts to State** | Android App     | `Fragments`, `SpeechFlowVisualizationView`       |
|  9   | **Session Data Persisted** | Cloud           | `Firebase Firestore`                             |

## üî¨ **The 4-Class AI Detection System**

A key innovation of this project is the custom 4-class AI model, which distinguishes between clinically significant stuttering events and normal speech disfluencies. This allows for more precise and effective therapeutic intervention.

### **Class Definitions**

| Class               | Category            | Clinical Significance                                     |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| üî¥ **Block** | Clinical Stutter    | Complete blockage of airflow; a primary therapy target.   |
| üü£ **Prolongation** | Clinical Stutter    | Unnatural stretching of sounds; requires intervention.    |
| üü† **Interjection** | Normal Disfluency   | Fillers like "um" or "uh"; less clinically significant.   |
| üü¢ **No_Stutter** | Fluent Speech       | The target goal; used as a baseline for fluency score.    |

This distinction allows the **`AdaptivePlanner`** to recommend targeted therapeutic exercises for clinical patterns while providing gentler, more encouraging feedback for normal disfluencies.
